# goggle-books
A web application which is a front-end to Google Books API.

## Purpose
The purpose of this web application is to allow the user to search for books that are available publically.
The user types in a search query, and then the application forwards the query to the Google Books REST API.
The output from there will be redirected back to the user in a pretty format.
